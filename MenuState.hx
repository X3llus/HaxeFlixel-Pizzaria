			                             and it is your job to accurately replicate the order, within the customer's patience. Your score will be impacted by the accuracy of your pizza, 
			                             and if you cant complete a customer's order before there paitence runs out, you will lose score. The control scheme for the game revolves around 
			                             mouse click and mouse drag interactions. Instructions for creating your pizza are detailed below.

			               Creating Your Pizza:

	     							     Pizza Dough: Pizza dough will spawn on the user's screen, and be the base of your pizza. Once you finish and submit your pizza, a new pizza dough will appear.
									   
									     Adding Ingredients: To add an ingredient to your pizza, simply locate the appropriate ingredient on your UI, and drag it onto your pizza dough, you will then 
									     notice it appear on your pizza.
									   
									     Following your order: As previously stated, it is important that you follow the customer's order when creating your pizzas. Adding extra ingredients, or 
									     failing to include some required ingredients will impact your score and performance. It is important to work on the order that was first in the queue, as 
									     working on other orders will not provide you with the correct score (You will be handing customers 1 customer 3â€™s order if you do not follow this rule). 
									     It is also important to note that as a part of your challenge, you cannot undo any ingredients or start over, so be careful with what you place on your pizza.
